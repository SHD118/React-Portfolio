          My name is Siddharth Desai with a degree in Computer Science from NJIT. I kick started my career at Lockheed Martin where I worked in the roles of Software Engineer and Systems Engineer. At Lockheed Martin, I worked on many complex and exciting projects SCOT-Aegis which simulated the environment for operators in ships that used the Aegis Combat system. I learned tremendously about different weapon systems, radar, sensors, luminator trajectory mathematics and much more. The complex work at Lockheed helped me develop a strong work ethic and improve my overall knowledge on how to be a better engineer. I am currently working at PSEG based out of NJ and support various applications  such as FileNet, McLaren, Axway, iManage and recently was given a new task to automate manual workflows, controls and upload data to a cloud environment. I have learned extensively about servers, security and network infrastructure. 
         
          A little more about me is that I have a dog named Hiro and a beautiful wife named Neha. My wife recently started a job in Colorado so we moved here and I am working fully remote. Some of my hobbies are reading manga, watching anime, and studying different topics such as philosophy, hydroponics, and astronomy. I also love working out, hiking, playing sports and of course playing video games.
