# Siddharth Desai Portfolio

## Description
I am in the field of information technology and seeking to become a full-stack developer. Born and raised in NJ and recently moved to Colorado and currently working fully remote. Living with my lovely wife and a puppy named Hiro in Broomfield Colorado. I graduated from NJIT with a degree in Computer science. I spent most of my career at Lockeed Martin as an engineer and now coming close to my 2 year mark at PSEG. I am always a team player and often go out of my way to help others whenever I can. I love learning and can spend hours reading about topics that interest me such as hydroponics, philosophy, physics, technology and much more. One of my goals is to create a nonprofit to help promote hydroponics to areas around the world where soil isnâ€™t rich and water is sparse. If my profile sparks interest and if I can contribute to your team feel free to reach out.
